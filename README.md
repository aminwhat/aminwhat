# Greetings, Mortals!! 👋

Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Amin, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a deep love for creating impactful applications. Whether it's web, mobile, or even performance-critical systems, I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Work With

### **Frontend Development**:
- **Flutter** – *This is Awesome!* I absolutely love building cross-platform apps with Flutter.
- **ReactJS & NextJS** – The dynamic duo for building sleek and scalable web apps.  
  - **TypeScript** – Strong typing for better tooling and maintainability.

### **Backend Development**:
- **Node.js** – *I ❤️ It* – My go-to for building fast, scalable backends.
  - **Express.js** – Lightweight and flexible web framework.
  - **NestJS** – A powerful framework for building robust and scalable server-side applications.
- **ASP.NET Core** – *WHAT THE HELL??!!! RUNNNNNNN!!!!* Well, sometimes we have to face the unknown, right?

### **Python**:
- **FastAPI** – Super fast, modern web framework for building APIs.
- **HuggingFace** – I dive deep into NLP and transformers.
- **Ollama** – Exploring AI in a whole new way (might surprise you!).
- No more Python, *do not expect more* –_- 

### **Systems Programming**:
- **Go** & **Rust** – *Sweet :)*
  - I turn to these languages when performance is absolutely critical.
  - I’ve used them to build low-level systems and high-performance applications where other tools just didn’t cut it.

## 🌍 Current Focus:
- Building scalable applications that make a difference.
- Exploring AI-driven projects, specifically around **HuggingFace** and **NLP**.
- Working on **3D game development** (Looking for Rust-based engines for high performance).

## 🧑‍💻 Let's Connect! 

- I'm always open to collaboration. Feel free to shoot me a message if you'd like to work on something together or just want to discuss tech!
- Have a question or need help? I’d be happy to assist where I can – though, let’s be honest, I need help myself sometimes 😅.

### 🌟 Fun Facts About Me:
- My workflow involves *lots* of caffeine ☕️.
- I am fascinated by cutting-edge technology, especially in AI and performance engineering.
- I dislike traditional game engine editors and prefer working with code – *fast refresh/hot reload is a must!*
